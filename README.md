 # Sky-CotL-Scripts

A public collection of mods for Sky: Children of the Light, the latest game by thatgamecompany!

## Project Overview
This project is organized into the following directories:
- [Canvas](./Canvas/) - This directory contains scripts and resources related to the Canvas modloader. Canvas is a lightweight wrapper around the Sky app that facilitates the creation and use of plug-ins.
- [GameGuardian](./GameGuardian/) - This directory houses GameGuardian, a tool that enables the modification of game data on Android devices by editing the device's Random Access Memory (RAM).
- [LUA Scripts](./LUA%20Scripts/) - This directory is home to various LUA scripts. These scripts offer a variety of modifications for the game.
- [Virtual Spaces](./Virtual%20Spaces/) - This directory contains a variety of virtual spaces. Virtual spaces are environments that allow for the execution of modified apps on Android devices without the need for root access.

## Goal
We aim to democratize game customization, allowing all players to discover and enjoy new ways of experiencing games beyond the standard gameplay.
