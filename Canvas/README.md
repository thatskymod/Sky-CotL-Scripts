# Welcome to Canvas!

## What's Canvas?
- ⚙️ **Canvas**, also known as **Sky Modloader**, is a lightweight wrapper around the Sky app made by [@artdeell](https://github.com/artdeell) and [@lukas0x1](https://github.com/lukas0x1). It takes up a sole **~15 MB** of your phone's storage and hooks into Sky at runtime, thus acting as "bridge" and providing an interface that developers can build plug-ins on top of. It's completely modular, so you can load existing plug-ins or write your own. The main advantage of Canvas over traditional mods is that it doesn't require elevated privileges or any specific programming skills. Canvas is important, but requires libs to be fully operational.

## Libs?
- 📚 **Userlibs**, or simply **Libs**, are fan-made helper programs (libraries) for Canvas that actually unleash its true power. Some of these libs include Auto CRing, melting, spell modification, or virtually anything as per your liking.

## Available Libs:
- **libdukun** (ex. **libaw4c**) - A free helper program that collects the max number of daily available candles at the tap of a button, with extra features such WL, spirit collection, etc.
- **liblangit** - Like above, a highly versatile tool for AutoCR, WL collection, and visual trickery.
- **libsMite** - Universal mod with Semi-AutoCR, Auto burn, Relationship unlocks, etc.
- **libRomanBeta** - Universal mod for Sky Beta.
- **libfun** - Universal mod, but paid and poorly maintained.

Discontinued - **!! do not use !!**
- **AutoWax** or **libaw4c** - A popular program that utilized the Sky protocol (API) to collect candles, quests, spirits and winged light. Development stopped.
- **reHell** or **libgxost** - Universal mod, no longer maintained
- **libHellboy** - Universal mod, no longer maintained
- **libRomanDev** - Redirects all game traffic to the Dev server (a private server reserved for TGC staff). Access is now restricted, if you're facing a "Game Data Corrupted" screen, make sure to remove/disable mods/settings related to this server.

⬆️ <ins>It's worth noting that these add-ons are fan-made and can have lots of advantages (or otherwise cause trouble) depending on the author's intentions.</ins> ⬆️

## System Requirements:
- A mobile phone capable of running Sky and Android not less than version 7.1
- Root is not necessary, but a basic understanding of sideloading, navigating the filesystem and technical troubleshooting might come in handy
- Apple iOS and emulators are not supported

## Getting Started

1. Download **Canvas.apk** from [here](https://github.com/RomanChamelo/Canvas-Open-Source/releases/latest/download/Canvas.apk) and **AutoWax** from [here](https://github.com/thatskymod/Sky-CotL-Scripts/raw/main/Canvas/Libs/libdukun142.so).
2. Open your File Manager and navigate to your **Downloads** (e.g. `/storage/emulated/0/Download/`).
3. Tap on **Canvas.apk**. If prompted, allow the installation from unknown sources and proceed.
4. Hit **"Done"** *(don't open yet!)*.
5. Find the newly added **"Mod Manager"** in your app drawer.

7. Repeat step 6 for any other mods you might have.
8. Close **Mod Manager** *(swipe from your recent apps)*.

## Updating old Mods
To update your existing mods (files ending in *.so), do the following:
1. Find and download a newer version of your mod.
2. Navigate to the **Mod Manager** on your home screen.
3. **Remove** the desired mod. To do so, press the 🗑️ (recycle bin) icon next to its name.

## Is Canvas safe?
- Canvas, in its core form, is entirely [safe](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b09f73105a674260f6228cff527b1dec12a654ae372a396b2ea5c06f90668d68), and its source code is publicly [available](https://github.com/artdeell/Canvas-Open-Source). This contributes to the app's transparency, and allows others to view, use, modify, and reproduce its source code. Canvas does permit modifications, from either third-party sources or not, to take complete charge of your active Sky instance, which includes the ability to access your account information and more. Therefore, exercising discretion and considering user reviews prior to usage is strongly recommended. Certain modifications present features viewed as 'risky', such as spam honk, teleportation by coordinates, auto melt, and more. These can attract attention from others and potentially result in reporting to TGC. It's important to note that any actions related to **cheating**, **hacking** or **exploiting** are **expressly forbidden** by TGC's [EULA/ToS](https://thatgamecompany.helpshift.com/hc/en/17-sky-children-of-the-light/faq/460-eula-terms-of-service/). Accounts identified as participating in these activities may be subject to **permanent closure**.
