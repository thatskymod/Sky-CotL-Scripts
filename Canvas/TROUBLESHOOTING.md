# Troubleshooting

Should you experience crashes with Canvas at any point, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the troubleshooting steps listed below.

### Isolating the Issue:

Mods operate at a very low level of the game's binary. While most mods are designed to be future-proof, there is a possibility that a mod could be patching an incorrect memory location, which the game might not tolerate well. To isolate the problem:

- Remove **all** mods from Canvas.
- Start Canvas **without** any mods. This will help you determine if the issue stems from Canvas itself or one of the mods you had installed.
- Add mods back one by one, starting the game after each addition.
- If a specific mod causes Canvas to crash, you will eventually identify it.
- **Remove** the mod identified in the previous step.
- Optional: Delete the downloaded file from your local storage to prevent further confusion.

> [!TIP]
> #### A mod under this name already exists
> If you get this message, first remove the existing mod. Only then add the new version.

### Updating Canvas:

Sometimes, the game may receive an update that necessitates an update for Canvas altogether. While this is rare, and Canvas might not get optimized immediately, you could try:

- Uninstalling Canvas (Settings -> Apps -> Canvas -> Uninstall).
- Downloading and installing the newest release of Canvas from [here](https://github.com/skyprotocol/Canvas-Open-Source/actions).
- Testing the new version to see if it resolves your problem.
- If this does not help, it is encouraged to remain patient until a new release is published. You may also consider reporting the problem and seeking help in relevant communities.

### Bug Reporting:

Please note that this repository is not the right place for bug reporting on individual mods. Discussions listed here won’t be seen by the developers themselves. To get assistance with specific mods, please reach out to the authors of the respective software directly.
