# Troubleshooting

Should you experience crashes with Canvas at any point, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the troubleshooting steps listed below.

### Isolating the Issue:

Mods operate at a very low level of the game's binary. While most mods are designed to be future-proof, there is a possibility that a mod could be patching an incorrect memory location, which the game might not tolerate well. To isolate the problem:

- Remove **all** mods from Canvas.
- Start Canvas **without** any mods. This will help you determine if the issue stems from Canvas itself or one of the mods you had installed.
- Add mods back one by one, starting the game after each addition.
- If a specific mod causes Canvas to crash, you will eventually identify it.
- **Remove** the mod identified in the previous step.
- Optional: Delete the downloaded file from your local storage to prevent further confusion.

> [!TIP]
> #### A mod under this name already exists
> If you get this message, first remove the existing mod. Only then add the new version.

### Updating Canvas:

Sometimes, the game may receive an update that necessitates an update for Canvas altogether. While this is rare, and Canvas might not get optimized immediately, you could try:

- Uninstalling Canvas (Settings -> Apps -> Canvas -> Uninstall).
- Downloading and installing the newest release of Canvas from [here](https://github.com/XeTrinityz/ThatSkyMod-Android/releases/latest).
- Testing the new version to see if it resolves your problem.
- If this does not help, it is encouraged to remain patient until a new release is published. You may also consider reporting the problem and seeking help in relevant communities.

### Bug Reporting:

Please note that this repository is not the right place for bug reporting on individual mods. Discussions listed here wonâ€™t be seen by the developers themselves. To get assistance with specific mods, please reach out to the authors of the respective software directly.
